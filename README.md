# bolliedelay.lv2

This is actually my first try to build a LV2 plugin and make it usable on the MOD Duo from https://www.moddevices.com

Expect many flaws regarding source quality and regarding design. My motivation was to create a simple delay, that uses one of the footswitches of the MOD for tap tempo.

This plugin can also be used outside the MOD world, by simply running:
- make
- make install

Have fun and input is always welcome! :D
